# frozen_string_literal: true

##
# Based loosely on the GoRails tutorial
# Adds soft deletable capability to an ActiveRecord model.
# The model requires the deleted_at:datetime attribute.
# It overrides the destroy method so instead of deleting the record
# it will add the current datetime to deleted_at.
# You also get some scoped methods for free.
# * deleted: returns a list of objects which have been soft deleted.
# * without_deleted: returns a list of objects excluding those which have been soft deleted.
# * with deleted: returns everything.
#
# There is also some capability to remove associations if you so wish.
# usage:
#  removable_associations :assoc_a, :assoc_b
#
# if implemented when you soft delete these associations will be set to nil.
#
