# Labwhere

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sanger/labwhere.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/sanger/labwhere)

A tool for tracking uniquely barcoded labware

## Getting Started

1. Get the right Ruby version
Make sure you have `ruby-2.5.6` installed. e.g. `rvm install ruby-2.5.6`.

1. Create a new gemset and install bundler (if necessary)

    ```bash
    rvm use ruby-2.5.6@rails526 --create
    gem install bundler
    ```

1. Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
1. Set up the local database
The local database uses `mysql`.

    ```bash
    bundle exec rails db:create
    bundle exec rails db:environment:set
    bundle exec rails db:schema:load
    ```

## Running The Specs

`bundle exec rspec`

## Running The Server

`bundle exec rails server`

## Generating the API Documentation

`bundle exec rails docs:api`

The documentation is written in [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) and converted to HTML
using the [Apiary CLI client](https://github.com/apiaryio/apiary-client) gem.

The documentation will be available at `/api`.

## Creating some dummy data

`bundle exec rails db:reload`

This will create a user, location types and locations in a nested structure similar to the live setup.

## Generate the correct restrictions

`bundle exec rails restrictions:create`

This will limit certain location parentage when creating locations and other restrictions seen in app/data/restrictions

## Removing all of the data

`bundle exec rails db:clear`

This will remove all of the existing data without resetting the database.

## Creating some dummy labwares

`bundle exec rails labwares:generate_barcodes[num]`

num = number of labwares that will be created.

This will create a number of labware barcodes that can then be scanned into the scan page.

## Pages

* **Scan In/Out (home page):** Scan labwares into a Location

* **Upload Labware:** Upload Labwares into a location

* **Move Locations:** Move any number of locations from one place to another (all child locations will also be moved)

* **Empty Location:** Remove all labwares from a location

* **Configure:** Administrator permissions are required but these pages allow you to create/update/deactivate Location Types, Locations, Users, Teams and Printers
